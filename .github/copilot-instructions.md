# AI Coding Assistant Instructions for ledger-line

## Project Overview

The ledger-line project is in its initial development phase with a minimal codebase. The project structure includes:

- `.rules`: A file containing core development and AI interaction guidelines.
- `public/brand/images/hero-placeholder.avif`: A placeholder branding image in AVIF format.

## Essential Knowledge

### Core Principles (from .rules)
- **Clarity over Cleverness**: Write code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **Accuracy**: Do not invent facts, metrics, testimonials, or capabilities.
- **Decision Making**: Ask before making major assumptions or irreversible design decisions.
- **Instruction Following**: Follow step-gated instructions strictly.

### Architecture and Structure
- The project uses a `public/` directory for static assets, suggesting a web application.
- Branding assets are stored in `public/brand/images/` using modern image formats like AVIF for optimization.

### Development Workflow
- Adhere to the principles in `.rules` for all code changes.
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability in code.

### Patterns and Conventions
- Static assets are organized in a `public/` directory structure.
- Image assets use AVIF format for web delivery.

## Integration Points
- No external dependencies or services identified yet in the current minimal codebase.

## Commands and Workflows
- No build or test commands established yet. Follow standard practices for web development as the project evolves.

## Examples
- Asset organization: Place branding images in `public/brand/images/` with descriptive names.
- Code style: Follow the clarity principle - e.g., prefer `calculateTotal(amount)` over abbreviated or clever implementations.
